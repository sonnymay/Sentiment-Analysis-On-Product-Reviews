## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. This project focuses on analyzing product reviews and classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the content.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. Download the NLTK data for VADER sentiment analysis:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   nltk.download('punkt')
   ```

## Usage

To use the sentiment analysis on product reviews, simply run the Python script `sentiment_analysis.py`. The script contains a sample list of product reviews, but you can modify it to analyze your own data.

```python
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

The output will display each review along with its sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
